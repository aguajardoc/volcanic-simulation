MATLAB app that graphically simulates the projectile motion of volcanic rock expelled from a volcano based on the model of air resistance proportional to the square of 
the velocity, assuming the projectiles are spheres with a drag coefficient of 0.5. 
The default values correspond to conditions present at the peak of the Popocat√©petl in Mexico; code is commented to reflect sources for said values.

The following values can be changed accordingly to suit users' needs:

- Spherical projectile diameter in meters
  
- Air density in kg m^-3
  
- Drag coefficient

- Initial position (x,y)

- Angle at launch in degrees

- Initial velocity in m/s

- Projectile mass in kg

- Simulation duration in seconds

- Minimum height in meters

- Step size in seconds

The app features a hold button to superimpose multiple trajectories at once, a reset button to return to default values, a "start simulation" button which acts according to 
the state of the hold button, and a "start random simulation" button that acts upon a selected number of projectiles.

This app was designed as the final project for my Computational  Modeling of Movement course, during my first semester at university. The course was taught in Spanish, so 
all elements of the app are implemented in Spanish.
